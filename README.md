# React TypeScript Todo App

A simple and intuitive Todo app built with React and TypeScript. This app lets you create, mark as complete, delete, and clear all your todos. Plus, it saves your todo list to the browser’s local storage, so everything stays even if you refresh the page.

## Key Features

- **Toggle Completion**: Click on a todo to mark it as done or undone—easy as that!
- **Delete a Todo**: Want to remove a task? Just click the delete icon on the todo.
- **Clear All Todos**: If you’re feeling productive, click the "Clear Todos" button to wipe out everything at once.
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**:
  - **Enter**: Quickly add a new todo.
  - **Backspace**: Instantly clear all todos.
  - **T**: Show or hide the keyboard shortcuts menu.
- **Persistent Data**: Your todos are saved in the browser’s local storage, so they’ll stick around even after you refresh the page.
